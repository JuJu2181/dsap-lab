# Title: Intro to DSP tools

## Objective:
- To be familiarized with DSP tools
- To plot discrete time elementary signals in MATLAB

## Theory

### DSP tools 
- Matlab, Basic Commands, & vectorized implementation
- Octave
- Elementary Signals

### Elementary Signals 
- [X] Unit Step Signal
- [X] Unit Impulse Signal
- [X] Unit Ramp Signal
- [X] Sinc Signal

### Other Signals
- [X] Exponential Signal

## Discussion
- Compare Vectorized and Non-Vectorized code 
- Discuss by using multiple signals in same graph using subplots
